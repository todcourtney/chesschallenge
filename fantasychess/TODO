fix gui bug where sells are sometimes not displayed (maybe is recovery race condition?)
finish reorganize public vs private
gateway:
  cancel all orders on disconnect
  pnl (need marks, probably best to use Book)
simple strategies
training
sim
message parsers ignore bad formats (only for client-generated messages)

matching engine recovery
split seq nums for game vs. market data?
fetchdata?
handle gateway disconnects gracefully (pull orders, leave pos so can quickly bounce if their code is good, will expire at EOG)
click trader?
ioc orders?
cleanup
pnl:
  drive all pnl traffic off gateway events, not special
  pnl this game
  open pnl
switch to level book?
final message format standardization and cleanup
switch to using logging library from python for thread-safe logging (also see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/384076/how-can-i-color-python-logging-output and threading ident)


game:
  if black has advantage, price can collapse very close to zero (white does not win even if draw), while white with advantage will hover below 100 (probably okay)
  test sessions, then real sessions (but can still modify, bounce?)
  will need a quick talk on rules of chess, value of material (should we warn them in advance to read up?), basic structure of markets (diagrams)
  everybody in JCS needs to play to create an ecosystem (may phase in over course of games)
